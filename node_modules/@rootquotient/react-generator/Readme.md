- Services
- Models
- Forms
- Validators

## Installation

```ssh

As shown above, a list displays,

- use the up and down arrow keys to navigate over the list
- select the list item

### Create a Project

Select Project option fron the react-generate list. Enter the project name when prompted (as words separated with space Ex. food app)
A react application gets created with name `food-app` and the folder structure as shown below:

For example we create a food-app,

- Context - contains all the context files while working with ContextApi, a user context is created here by default
- Enums - contains shared constants used in the app
- Interceptor - axios interceptor for http requests
- Models - contains object models using the json collection used in serialization and deserialization of objects while sending requests and receiving response from DB
- Routes - contains routes and route constants for both api and app routes
- Services - contains http request services file
- Shared - contains shared components, hooks and utilities of the application
- Styles - contains global shared scss files
- Views - contains functional components rendered at different routes of the app
- The project contains a ts config file too

> **Note**: To generate components, services, models, forms or/and validators, using the CLI, go to the project folder inside which you want to create those

### Component

- From CLI, enter ` react-generate`
- Select Component option from the list
- Enter the component name (as words separated with space)
- Press 'Y' if its a shared component else 'n'
- A default path gets displayed, press enter to proceed or input the desired path relative to the root directory. Ex: ./src/views/ProductsList
- The component is created at the desired path containing a typescript and an scss file with the basic starter code
- Repeat the steps to create multiple components

### Service

- From CLI, enter ` react-generate`
- Select Service option from the list
- Enter the service template name (as words separated with space) Ex: menu item

### Model

To create all the object models, move the json collection to the project root as input.json
It automatically creates all the required models

**input.json File Sample**

```

    "model":{
        "menu_items": [
